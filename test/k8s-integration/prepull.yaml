      # To see containers that are known to be used in e2e tests, run this
      # command against the build-log.txt output from a test run:
      #   grep -v 'Node Info: &Node' build-log.txt \
      #     | grep -ho -E 'e2eteam/([[:alnum:]_-]+):([[:alnum:]./_-]+)' \
      #     | sort | uniq
      # NOTE: this command captures only a subset of the test containers,
      # unfortunately; not all test containers will have their names printed in
      # the test output. Running the command against the output from multiple
      # test runs is also recommended. Filtering out the 'Node Info' lines
      # avoids capturing containers that are only found in the test log
      # *because* we prepulled them. Overall this command may be useful for
      # detecting newly-used test containers but there's not a great way to
      # prune unused containers from this manifest right now.
      #
      # Examining initImageConfigs() in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/test/utils/image/manifest.go may also help, but many of the containers listed there are only used for Linux tests.
      #
      # DaemonSets do not support a RestartPolicy other than 'Always', so we
      # run ping in each container to keep it alive so that kubernetes does not
      # continually restart the containers while we're prepulling.
